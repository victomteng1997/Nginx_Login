#1. Install Elasticsearch, Kibana and Nginx

#2. By default, Elasticsearch and Kibana are configured to be localhost access only. To doublecheck, verify in elasticsearch.yml and kibana.yml:

##elasticsearch.yml:
network.host: 127.0.0.1 (or just comment out this line. By default, elasticsearch is only open to localhost.)
##kibana.yml
server.host: "localhost" (or just comment out this line. By default, kibana is only open to localhost.)

#3. Create password for nginx login using htpasswd:
$ htpasswd -c /path/to/file/.htpasswd <username>
then key in password. 
In the following example, password is stored in /etc/nginx/passwd/.login through command:
$ htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/passwd/.login <username>

#4. Configure Nginx with nginx.conf
In the attached configuration file, two local proxy listner are set on port 8881 and 8882 with authentication.
After user login with credentials created in the previous step, the traffice from those two ports will be redirected to localport 9200 (elasticsearch) and 5601 (kibana).

#5. Verification
After proper setups, restart the elasticsearch, kibana and nginx services.
To verify that the above configurations are done properly:

$ curl 127.0.0.1:9200
{
  "name" : "ubuntu1804",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
...

$ curl 127.0.0.1:5601/app/kibana
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><meta charSet="utf-8"/><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1"/><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"/><title>Elastic</title><style>
...

$ curl public_ip:9200
curl: (7) Failed to connect to public_ip port 9200: Connection refused

$ curl public_ip:5601
curl: (7) Failed to connect to public_ip port 5601: Connection refused

$ curl -u <username>:<password> public_ip:8881
same as localport 9200

$ curl curl -u <username>:<password> public_ip:8882/app/kibana
same as localport 5601

User can also verify from brower.
